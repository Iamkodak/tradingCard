          An Axolotl is a paedomorphic salamander. Its is unusual among
          amphibians in that it reached adulthood without undergoing
          metarmorphosis. Instaed of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic
          and gilled. The species was originally found in several lakes
          underlying what is now mexico city, such as lake Xochimilco, and lake
          Chalco.This lake was drained by the spanish settlers after the
          conquests of the Aztec Empire, leading to the destruction of much of
          the axolotl's natural habitat.

          Asexually matured aduly axolotl, at ade 18-27 months, range in length
          from 15-45cm, although a size close to 23cm is most common and greater
          than 30cm is rare. Axolotls possess features typical of salamander
          larvae, including external gills and a caudal fin extending from
          behind the head to the vent. External gills are usually lost when
          salamander species mature into adulthood, although the axolotl
          maintains this feature. This is due to their neoteny evoloution, where
          axolotls are much aquatic than the other salamder species. Males are
          identified by thier swollen cloacae lined with papilae, while females
          are noticeable for their wider bodies full of eggs.
